# INEMO-development-board
The development board for Callen's MSc has been adapted for undergraduate students (and other projects). LIDAR setup and reading has been commented out so it will compile and run without the LIDAR connected. Just grab an STM32F4 to use the ST-LINK debugger hardware, and provide the iNEMO with 5V, GND, and the SWD connector.
